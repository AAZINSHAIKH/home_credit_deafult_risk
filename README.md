## Home Credit Default Risk

<p>Normally, lenders make a profit only when a particular loan is repaid. When a borrower does not repay the loan for more than a certain number of days, the lending institution considers that loan to be Written-Off. This basically means that even though the bank tries its best to carry out loan recoveries, it does not expect the loan to be repaid anymore. Due to this, lenders face the challenge of identifying high-risk borrowers i.e., people who do not intend to repay the loan but get away with acquiring a loan with people who are capable of paying it back. 
To address this challenge, we will try to build a Machine Learning Solution that is going to predict the probability of a client’s ability to repay a loan given a set of features in our dataset. This Solution will help the borrowers as well as the lenders to minimize any potential risks. 
To achieve this goal, we will holistically address multiple aspects of the customer’s background apart from credit histories such as demographic data, financial data, etc. by experimenting with several Machine Learning algorithms and selecting the best model based on the highest accuracy achieved.</p>
